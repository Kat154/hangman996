# Hangman GameHangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts. In this project, we've created a Python implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer selects a secret word, and the user tries to guess it.
## Project DescriptionThe goal of this project is to create an interactive Hangman game. The user will have a limited number of attempts to guess the secret word. If they guess correctly within the allotted attempts, they win; otherwise, they lose the game.
## Installation Instructions
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
- Run the milestone.py script to start the game.
## Usage Instructions- Run the milestone.py script in your terminal or IDE.
- The computer will select a random word for the user to guess.
- Enter a letter to guess. The game will display the current state of the word, including correctly guessed letters.
- Keep guessing until you either guess the entire word or run out of attempts.
- Have fun playing Hangman!
